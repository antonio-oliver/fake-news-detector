![fake-news.jpg](https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/newspaper-background-concept_23-2149501641.jpg)

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to detect fake news in articles and online content. With the rise of misinformation on digital platforms, identifying and filtering out fake news has become a crucial task. Our project aims to automatically classify news articles as *real* or *fake* by analyzing the text content, providing a scalable and efficient tool for addressing this global challenge.

## 📖 Overview

This project is built with **Python** 🐍 and uses **Machine Learning** and **NLP** libraries like **NLTK**, **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **Transformers** from Hugging Face 🤗. We train models on labeled datasets of news articles, analyzing linguistic features, syntactic structures, and semantic context to predict the authenticity of the content.

### 🎯 Key Goals:
1. **Automate fake news detection**: Reduce reliance on manual fact-checking.
2. **Improve accuracy over time**: Continuously fine-tune models with more data.
3. **Provide a user-friendly tool**: Make it accessible for journalists, researchers, and general users.

## ✨ Features

- **🧹 Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses news text (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, etc.)
- **🔍 Feature Extraction**: Uses methods like TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), and advanced transformers (BERT, RoBERTa) for feature extraction.
- **🔧 Multiple Model Support**: Implements several machine learning models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Deep Learning (LSTM, BERT, etc.)
- **📊 Classification Reports**: Provides precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix for model evaluation.
- **🔄 Continuous Learning**: Allows the model to improve with incremental training on new datasets.

## ⚙️ Installation

To set up the project locally, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```
4. **You can also instal them using `poetry`**:
   ```bash
   poetry install 
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare text data for training:
     ```bash
     python src/preprocessing.py
     ```

2. **Train the Model**:
   - Train the model using the feature extraction and training scripts:
     ```bash
     python src/model_training.py
     ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - Generate evaluation metrics to assess model accuracy and reliability:
     ```bash
     python src/evaluate_model.py
     ```

4. **Predict on New Data**:
   - Use the trained model to classify new articles as fake or real:
     ```bash
     python src/predict.py --input path/to/article.txt
     ```

## 📚 Model Details

The project includes multiple NLP models for fake news detection, focusing on two main types:

1. **🧠 Traditional Machine Learning Models**:
   - **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes** are used for baseline performance. These models rely on TF-IDF and word frequency features to classify text.

2. **💡 Deep Learning Models**:
   - **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) that captures temporal dependencies in text.
   - **Transformers** (BERT, RoBERTa): These state-of-the-art models use self-attention mechanisms to understand context and semantics, offering high accuracy for text classification tasks.

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics are used to evaluate the model performance:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The ability of the model to capture all real instances of fake news.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A summary of prediction results across classes.
